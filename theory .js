1. What is high-level design, and how does it differ from low-level design?

    High-Level Design (HLD): Focuses on the overall architecture of the system, including components, modules, and their interactions. It provides a bird's-eye view of the system.
    Low-Level Design (LLD): Deals with the implementation details of individual components, including algorithms, class diagrams, and data structures.

2.Explain the key components of a high-level design document.

    Architecture Diagram: Visual representation of system components and their relationships.
    Modules and Components: Breakdown of the system into modules with defined responsibilities.
    Data Flow: Flow of data between components.
    Technology Stack: Technologies used for each part of the system.
    APIs and Interfaces: Communication protocols between services.
    Scalability and Performance Considerations: How the system handles load, caching, and scaling.
