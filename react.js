1. Build a Dynamic Form Builder
Description:
Create a dynamic form builder where users can add different types of form fields (e.g., text input, dropdown, checkbox, radio button) and preview the form in real-time.

Requirements:

Allow users to add/remove form fields dynamically.

Each field should have configurable properties (e.g., label, placeholder, required, options for dropdown/radio).

Render a live preview of the form as fields are added/configured.

Save the form configuration to local storage and load it on page reload.

Use React state management (e.g., Context API, Redux, or Zustand) to manage the form state.

Skills Tested:

Dynamic component rendering.

State management.

Form handling and validation.

Local storage integration.

2. Infinite Scrolling List with API Integration
Description:
Build an infinite scrolling list that fetches data from an API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder or a custom API) and renders items as the user scrolls.

Requirements:

Fetch data from an API in chunks (e.g., 10 items at a time).

Implement infinite scrolling using the Intersection Observer API or scroll events.

Show a loading spinner while fetching data.

Handle edge cases (e.g., no more data to load, API errors).

Optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders (e.g., using React.memo or useMemo).

Skills Tested:

API integration.

Performance optimization.

Infinite scrolling implementation.

Error handling.

3. Real-Time Collaborative Todo List
Description:
Build a real-time collaborative todo list where multiple users can add, edit, and delete tasks. Changes should be reflected in real-time across all users.

Requirements:

Use WebSocket or a real-time database (e.g., Firebase) to sync data between users.

Allow users to add, edit, and delete tasks.

Show a live update of tasks without refreshing the page.

Implement user authentication (optional but recommended).

Use React state management to handle local state and sync it with the server.

Skills Tested:

Real-time data synchronization.

WebSocket integration.

State management.

Authentication (optional).

4. Drag-and-Drop Kanban Board
Description:
Create a Kanban board with drag-and-drop functionality to move tasks between columns (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Done").

Requirements:

Implement drag-and-drop using a library like react-beautiful-dnd or react-dnd.

Allow users to add new tasks and columns.

Persist the board state to local storage.

Optimize performance for large boards (e.g., virtualized lists).

Use React state management to handle the board state.

Skills Tested:

Drag-and-drop implementation.

State management.

Performance optimization.

Local storage integration.

5. Customizable Dashboard with Widgets
Description:
Build a customizable dashboard where users can add, remove, and rearrange widgets (e.g., charts, tables, notes).

Requirements:

Allow users to add/remove widgets from a predefined list.

Implement drag-and-drop to rearrange widgets.

Each widget should display dynamic data (e.g., fetch data from an API or use mock data).

Save the dashboard layout to local storage and load it on page reload.

Use React state management to handle the dashboard layout and widget data.

Skills Tested:

Drag-and-drop implementation.

Dynamic component rendering.

API integration.

State management.

Local storage integration.

Bonus Tips for Machine Coding Rounds
Focus on Clean Code:

Write modular, reusable components.

Follow best practices for naming conventions and folder structure.

Optimize Performance:

Use React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback where necessary.

Avoid unnecessary re-renders.

Handle Edge Cases:

Test for empty states, loading states, and error states.

Validate user inputs and handle API errors gracefully.

Document Your Code:

Add comments to explain complex logic.

Write a brief README explaining how to run the project.

Use Modern React Features:

Use functional components and hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect, useContext).

Avoid class components unless absolutely necessary.

These questions are designed to test a candidate's ability to build complex, real-world applications using React. They also evaluate their understanding of performance optimization, state management, and integration with external APIs or libraries.
